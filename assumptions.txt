Layers:
- cells -- tumor, immune
- ECM -- binary? density?
- oxygen -- constant concentration source? vasculature?
- tumor toxine
- recruitment substance -- only tumor cells? immune cells?

Immune cells randomly appear in free sites -- constant number of immune cells? or dependent on recruitment substance level?
Immune cells die after some time or if they kill some number of tumor cells.
